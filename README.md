### Project Description ###

The web app is designed for a myriad of customer types. Someone who recently moved into the city or neighborhood for example would be an ideal candidate. It saves that person the hassle of (1) looking for the perfect stylist, and (2) a salon that is pretty affordable. Another type would be those that just hate waiting for their turn at a salon. You could argue that people can set appointments. Yes, that is true. But there are circumstances that appointments are not really followed to the dot (like emergency cases or if the stylist enjoys the company of that other person more than you).

### Author's Notes ###

This is a pure SASS, CSS, and HTML mock project. No JavaScript for animations, transitions, transforms, etc. AND yes I rediscovered my appreciation for SASS. 

This project also allowed me to familiarize myself with the 7-1 architecture. It is pretty awesome. It also solidified my knowledge of more advanced CSS styling.
